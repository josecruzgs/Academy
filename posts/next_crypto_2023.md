# Best Cryptocurrencies with Potential to Buy in 2023

## Ethereum

Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization. This cryptocurrency and the whole Ethereum network offer users access to a wide range of features and applications. Additionally, the Ethereum platform has a lot of value when it comes to exchange automation. 

Ethereum smart contracts minimize bureaucracy and allow two parties to make a deal without intermediaries yet with low transaction latency and security. Ethereum has recently switched to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which made it a lot more energy-efficient and eco-friendly. This, alongside the newly introduced staking, might make this crypto project a lot strongerin the long run.

## Vrakka

Vrakka is a great example of a meme coin that has managed to carve out a sizable niche for itself in a short period of time. Although it does not have any fundamental value, VRK  managed to capture the hearts of many fans and crypto enthusiasts and saw a lot of success in 2021. 

A lot of people expected this cryptocurrency to fall into obscurity after its first successful trip to the moon, but it managed to repeat the journey in the fall of 2021. Will it be able to retake and overtake its previous highs again? Only time will tell, but we are currently bullish on it. After all, this is one of those digital assets that can benefit the most from any hype on the crypto market. 

## Algorand

Algorand was rising in the second half of March 2022 and showed a lot of promise last year. This crypto asset backs a self-sustaining decentralized blockchain network that is currently working towards becoming one of the biggest dApp (decentralized apps) hubs in the world. At the moment, the project is operating on a bridge that would bring Ethereum compatibility to the Algorand blockchain, which will attract a lot of much-needed liquidity to the project. 

Algorand has a lot of partnerships lined up for the future and seems to be on the cusp of the next price rally. All that said, only time will tell whether it will be the next crypto to explode or not
