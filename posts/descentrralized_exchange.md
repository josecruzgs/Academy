Blockchain use scenarios keep emerging worldwide, and understanding the underlying technologies is the crucial part of navigating the cryptocurrency market. As of lately, it’s becoming increasingly more important to understand what a decentralized exchange (DEX) is and how they work in the crypto sphere. 

DEXs provide users with an invaluable service: the ability to independently trade cryptocurrencies without relying on either centralized exchanges or third-party brokers. In comparison to conventional exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance, DEXs offer increased security, privacy, and anonymity that appeals to many types of investors.  

If you’ve been considering using a DEX for trading cryptocurrencies but don’t know where to start, this blog post will explain everything you need to know about decentralized exchanges!

## What Is Crypto Exchange?

A crypto exchange is a platform for buying and selling digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many others. A crypto exchange works similarly to a traditional stock exchange or foreign currency exchange. There are two main types of exchanges, centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges. Let’s examine these two closer.

## What Is a Centralized Exchange?

The classic approach to cryptocurrency exchanges comes from centralized exchanges (CEXs). These exchanges serve as intermediaries, keeping users’ funds safe and carrying out trades for them.  When using a CEX, customers generally have to complete Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks which can take a while and require personal information.

## What Is a DEX (Decentralized Exchange)?

As opposed to the traditional approach, DEXs offer users a way to exchange and trade cryptocurrencies without needing the involvement of a third-party intermediary. DEXs eliminate the need for a third-party to hold user funds or facilitate trading by utilizing smart contracts on blockchain networks. 

Smart contracts are computer protocols that execute themselves when predetermined conditions are met, and are used to facilitate financial transactions on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) over a blockchain network. DEXs are typically less regulated than centralized exchanges and offer features such as atomic swaps and trustless transactions.
